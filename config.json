  "text": "This website showcases example outputs from SURF (Surfacing Unintended Response Failures) run against several frontier models. These results accompany our paper [Chunky Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05910).\n\nSURF finds instances where models produce contextually inappropriate behavior—for example, generating code in response to a non-technical query. This demonstrates that models don't always exercise good judgment about appropriate responses and may over-index on non-salient prompt features.\n\nSURF optimizes over prompt category descriptors. Each iteration samples categories from an attribute pool, composes them into prompts, and scores model responses against a rubric. Categories that induce higher-scoring responses are upweighted for subsequent iterations.\n\nWhere available, we show reproducibility data: each prompt was regenerated 20 times, with the percentage exhibiting poor behavior displayed. LLM-generated translations are also provided.\n\nCode and technical details are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/seoirsem/SURF).",
